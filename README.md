# Bike Shop Website Portfolio Project

Welcome to our Bike Shop Website Portfolio Project! In this project, we developed a fully functional website for a bike shop using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap library.

## Introduction

We conducted thorough research to ensure an engaging and user-friendly design. To achieve this, we utilized ChatGPT to generate clean texts and descriptions for the website. The photos were sourced from Google, and ChatGPT was also employed for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to optimize our website's visibility.

## Setup or Installation

Simply clone the repository to start working on the project. There is no additional installation required.

We hope you find this portfolio project helpful and inspiring for your own web development journey. Happy coding! üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
